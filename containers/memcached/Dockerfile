# Container with memcached
#
# VERSION               0.0.1
#
#
# Guidelines
# ----------
#
# * Always use ubuntu:latest. Problems with new ubuntu releases should be fixed before
#  moving new images into production.
#
# * Daemons are managed with supervisord.
#
# * Logging from all daemons should be performed to `/var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log`.
#   The start script will `tail -f` this log so it shows up in `docker logs`. The log file of 
#   daemons that can't log to `/var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log` should also be tailed
#   in `start.sh`
#
