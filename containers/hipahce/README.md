1. Clone the hipache repo: `git clone https://github.com/dotcloud/hipache.git`
1. Build the docker image and start a container
1. Configure with `redis-cli`


NOTE: This Dockerfile comes with hipache. I'm getting and error when I try to build: `2013/10/21 14:00:24 unexpected EOF`.
The alternative is to run hipache under the OS (not within a container). This works fine (for me at least).
