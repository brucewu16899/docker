Docker.io environment
=====================

Linux containers is a nice tecnnology that is increasing in popularity. Below are instructions
for hotwo get started running OpenERP on CoreOS which is using docker containers. See README-OSX.md
for instruction about howto install on OSX.


Pre-requisite:

 * VirtualBox and vagrant, see vagrantup.com
 * Or EC2 instance, minimum m1.medium with 100GB disk

Installation:

1. `vagrant up ubuntu` - create and start a virtual machine - it is also possible to use coreos `vagrant up coreos` 
1. `vagrant ssh ubuntu` - login to the virtual machine - for coreos do `vagrant ssh coreos`

It will take some time to download everything the first time. Starting the virtual machine and
new continers is quickly done once they've been downloaded.


Configuration
------------

docker need to be configured to open up the HTTP API. The start script needs to look something like this `exec /usr/bin/docker -d -H 127.0.0.1:4243`.
For ubuntu, this is changed in `/etc/init/docker.conf`. Now the docker command line tool needs the flag `-H=tcp://127.0.0.1:4242`. Create
an alias for simplcity: `alias docker='docker -H=tcp://127.0.0.1:4243'`. Place this in your `.profile` etc.


### DNS server

DNS server to use in order to access Postgres using a name rather that an IP: `sudo npm install -g redis-dns --production`

```
# First show the IP of the docker bridge
ifconfig |grep -A 7 docker0

# This is the redis-dns configuration
cat /usr/lib/node_modules/redis-dns/redis-dns-config.json

# Check that the redis server is running
sudo service redis-server status

# Start the server using the symlink
./start-redis-dns

# Check the log
sudo cat /var/log/redis-dns.log
```

Test:

 * Configure the server like this: `redis-cli set redis-dns:dbserver.local 172.17.42.100`
 * Check what the DNS server says: `dig @[IPAddress] dbserver.local`


Test within a container:


```
# Start a container, just for playing around in
docker run -t -i -dns=172.17.42.1 ubuntu /bin/bash

# Install dig and nano
apt-get install -y dnsutils nano net-tools ping

# Check if the DNS finds the dbserver that was setup above
dig dbserver
```


Redis CLI:

```
ubuntu@ip-10-48-201-164:~/openerp-env/containers$ redis-cli
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
1) "redis-dns:dbserver"
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> get redis-dns:dbserver
"172.17.42.100"
```


For CoreOS
----------

1. Start with creating a container that simplfies the management of CoreOOS: `JACC=$(docker run -d colmsjo/jacc /usr/sbin/sshd -D -e -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config)`
1. `docker ps` will show the containers running. $JACC has the ID for the container just created.
1. Get the IP for the new container: `docker inspect $JACC
 * This will save the IP in a variable: `CONTAINER_IP=$(docker inspect $JACC | grep IPAddress | awk '{ print $2 }' | tr -d ',"')`
1. Now do `ssh root@$CONTAINER_IP`. The password is 'jacc'


Tips and tricks
--------------

1. Often, docker will consume the disk when several images are built. The way to check what images that consumes the disk space is:
 * containers - `sudo sh -c "ls -d /var/lib/docker/containers/* | xargs du -h -s | sort"`
 * All containers are showed with `docker ps -a` (also those that are stopped)
 * Remove stopped containers not being used (running containers can't be removed so there is no need to worry about that) - `docker rm [ID]`
 * show images - graph      - `sudo sh -c "ls -d /var/lib/docker/graph/* | xargs du -h -s | sort"`
